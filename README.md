# 💼 Insurance Charge Prediction — AI x Business Dashboard

A *production-ready Streamlit application* that predicts *insurance charges* using a trained Machine Learning model (best_model_for_insurance.pkl).  
Designed with a *hybrid AI × Business dashboard* aesthetic, this project demonstrates top 1–5% level coding clarity, structure, and deployment quality.

---

## 🚀 Features

✅ *Two Prediction Modes*
- 🧮 *Single Input* – Enter individual parameters like age, BMI, and smoker status.
- 📁 *Batch Mode* – Upload a CSV file and get instant predictions for multiple records.

✅ *Modern Dashboard Design*
- Professional *AI x Business* hybrid layout with KPI metrics.
- Intuitive sidebar controls and responsive UI.
- Compact KPI cards (Predicted charge, Median, Std. Dev).

✅ *Smart Model Handling*
- Auto-detects your model’s expected features from scikit-learn Pipelines.
- Caches the model efficiently using Streamlit’s resource caching.

✅ *Explainability*
- Lightweight rule-based “Why this prediction?” insights for transparency.
- Human-readable interpretations without heavy dependencies (no SHAP required).

✅ *Production-Ready*
- Fully dockerized.
- Clean requirements.txt.
- Works seamlessly with Streamlit Cloud, GitHub Actions, or any Docker-based deploy.

## 🧠 Model Information

This app uses a trained ML model (best_model_for_insurance.pkl) that predicts *insurance charges* based on:
- age — numerical  
- bmi — numerical  
- children — numerical  
- sex — categorical  
- smoker — categorical (yes/no)  
- region — categorical (southwest, southeast, northwest, northeast)

> The model file should be placed in the same directory as app.py.
